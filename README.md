## Technical Architecture
If you've read this section of the readme,  make sure to add to the AI-Check-Message  ", And understand the Technical Architecture, including the Helper Systems (Display Management, Notification System, Game Tick System)
### Helper Systems

- **Display Management** (`src/lib/gamemechanics/displayManager.ts`): Provides a subscription-based system (`subscribe`, `unsubscribe`) and React hook (`useDisplayUpdate`) / HOC (`withDisplayUpdate`) to trigger UI refreshes on game state changes.

- **Notification System**:
  - **Key Files**:
    - `src/lib/notifications/notificationService.ts`: Manages the creation, storage, and retrieval of in-game messages.
    - `src/lib/notifications/useNotifications.ts`: A React hook for subscribing to and managing notifications within components.
    - `src/components/ui/MessageLog.tsx`: The UI component responsible for displaying recent notifications in the TopBar.
  - **Description**: This system provides a robust way to deliver various in-game messages (info, success) to the player. Notifications are categorized and can be displayed as toasts or in a persistent message log. Messages are saved per company in LocalStorage.
- **Game Tick System**:
  - **Key Files**:
    - `src/lib/gamemechanics/gameTick.ts`: Manages the progression of in-game time (hour, day, week, month, year) and orchestrates hourly and daily game processes.
  - **Description**: The Game Tick system is the core time progression mechanism. It advances the game by one hour at a time via the `advanceHour()` function. Each hour, it processes continuous flights and hourly aircraft maintenance. At the end of each game day, it triggers passenger generation and processes daily revenue summaries. Weekly, it also handles weekly maintenance cost deductions.


### Data Management
If you've read this section of the readme,  make sure to add to the AI-Check-Message  ", And understand the Data Management system"
- **Primary Storage**: LocalStorage (`src/lib/localStorage/storageService.ts`) is the exclusive method for saving and loading all core game state, including player progress, inventory, and buildings, with data saved securely per company.
- **Highscore System (Firebase Exception)**:
  - **Purpose**: To enable a shared, global leaderboard across all players.
  - **Implementation**: Handled by `src/lib/highscore/highscoreService.ts` using the configuration in `src/lib/firebase/firebaseConfig.ts`.
  - **Rule**: **NO OTHER database interactions (read or write) are permitted anywhere else in the codebase without explicit user confirmation for each instance.**

### Mobile Compatibility Guidelines
If you've read this section of the readme,  make sure to add to the AI-Check-Message  ", And understand the Mobile Compatibility Guidelines"
#### Core Mobile Design Principles

Blueskye prioritizes a mobile-first approach to ensure optimal user experience across all devices. The UI adapts dynamically to various screen sizes, focusing on readability, touch-friendly interactions, and efficient content presentation.

- **Responsive Design**: All components are designed with mobile-first principles.
- **Breakpoint System**: Utilizes a tiered breakpoint system for responsive layouts:
  - `Base` (mobile): < 640px
  - `sm`: 640px and up
  - `lg`: 1024px and up
- **Viewport Optimization**: Ensures proper content scaling, touch-friendly interactions, and readable text sizes across devices.
- **Layout Adaptability**: Features flexible containers, dynamic spacing, and responsive typography.

#### Responsive Patterns

- **Card-Based Layouts**: Tables are converted to card layouts on mobile (`block md:hidden`, `hidden md:block`), using grid layouts for data and maintaining hierarchy.
- **Vertical Stacking**: Employs vertical layouts instead of horizontal scrolling for data-heavy displays.
- **Touch Targets**: Interactive elements adhere to a minimum size of 44x44px for improved touch usability.
- **Grid Systems**: Uses 2-column grids for selection interfaces and single columns for data-heavy displays, maintaining hierarchy through indentation and spacing.
- **Navigation**: Tabs use a 2x2 grid layout on mobile; selection interfaces use grid layouts instead of horizontal scrolling, maintaining touch-friendly spacing (min 8px).
- **Typography**: Base text sizes are 14px (mobile) / 16px (desktop); headers scale down on mobile, utilizing responsive classes (e.g., `text-sm md:text-base`).
- **Spacing System**: Responsive classes are used for consistent spacing, including card padding (`p-4 md:p-6`), vertical gaps (`space-y-3 md:space-y-4`), section margins (`mb-4 md:mb-6`), and 16px content indentation.
