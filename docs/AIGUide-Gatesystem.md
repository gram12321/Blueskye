# ‚úàÔ∏è Gate System Implementation Guide for Blueskye Air Management Game

## üéØ Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive gate management system for Blueskye, transforming the current unlimited airport capacity model into a realistic, resource-constrained environment where gate management becomes a core strategic element of airline operations.

---

## üìã Implementation Progress Plan

### **Phase 1: Data Structure & Types Foundation**
**Goal**: Establish the core data structures for gate management

**Components to create/modify:**
- `src/lib/geography/gateTypes.ts` - New types for gates, slots, and bookings
- `src/lib/geography/gateData.ts` - Enhanced airport data with detailed gate information
- Extend existing `Airport` interface in `cityTypes.ts`

**Key Data Structures:**
- `GateType` (exclusive/preferential/common)
- `GateSlot` (time-based slot allocation)
- `GateBooking` (route-to-slot assignments)
- `GatePricing` (dynamic pricing based on modifiers)

### **Phase 2: Gate Service Layer**
**Goal**: Core business logic for gate management

**Components to create:**
- `src/lib/geography/gateService.ts` - Main gate management service
- `src/lib/geography/gatePricingService.ts` - Pricing calculations

**Key Functions:**
- Gate availability checking
- Slot allocation/deallocation
- Pricing calculations with all modifiers
- Conflict detection and resolution

### **Phase 3: Route Integration**
**Goal**: Integrate gate requirements into existing route system

**Components to modify:**
- `src/lib/routes/routeService.ts` - Add gate booking to route creation
- `src/lib/routes/routeTypes.ts` - Extend route types with gate information // add too existing route types no type extension

**Key Changes:**
- Route creation now requires gate slot booking
- Gate costs added to route profitability calculations
- Slot availability validation before route activation

### **Phase 4: UI Components**
**Goal**: User interface for gate management

**Components to create:**
- `src/components/ui/Cards/GateInfoCard.tsx` - Gate availability display
- `src/components/ui/GateBookingPanel.tsx` - Gate selection/booking interface
- `src/components/views/GateManagementView.tsx` - Dedicated gate management view

**Key Features:**
- Visual gate availability calendar
- Pricing comparison between gate types
- Slot conflict warnings

### **Phase 5: Financial Integration**
**Goal**: Connect gate costs to finance system

**Components to modify:**
- `src/lib/finance/financeService.ts` - Add gate rental transactions
- Route profitability calculations including gate costs

### **Phase 6: Advanced Features**
**Goal**: Implement sophisticated gate management features

**Advanced Features:**
- Long-term gate leasing vs. per-use pricing
- Peak hour pricing dynamics
- Airport-specific policies (fixed blocks vs. flexible)
- Gate upgrade/downgrade options

## üèóÔ∏è Gate System Specifications

### üè∑Ô∏è Gate Use Types
Each gate can have one of three usage types, affecting cost and scheduling:

| Type           | Control Level | Price Multiplier | Booking Model                            |
| :------------- | :------------ | :--------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `exclusive`    | Full          | 1.5√ó             | Long-term lease (daily/weekly)           |
| `preferential` | Priority only | 1.2√ó             | Semi-exclusive (block-based or fixed-time use) |
| `common`       | None          | 1.0√ó             | Per-block rental, shared between airlines |

### ‚è±Ô∏è Gate Slot Duration Model
Slot allocation time ‚âà turnaround time + buffer

Airports typically enforce standardized block lengths for scheduling and billing

| Flight Type        | Approx. Time Required | Notes                |
| :----------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------- |
| Small domestic     | 60 min (45 + 15)     | Fast turnaround      |
| Large domestic     | 75 min (60 + 15)     | More boarding time   |
| Intl short-haul    | 90 min (75 + 15)     | Border control       |
| Intl long-haul     | 135‚Äì180 min          | Large aircraft ops   |

**üß† In common-use scenarios, gate is usually rented in fixed blocks (e.g. 90 min), even if actual turnaround is shorter.**

### üõ´ Gate Capacity Model
Operating day = ~18 hours (e.g., 06:00‚Äì00:00)

Slot count per gate = Total time / Slot duration

E.g., 18 √ó 60 √∑ 90 = 12 slots per gate per day (for 90-minute blocks)

### üí∞ Price Calculation Formula

```javascript
price = base √ó gateTypeMultiplier
       √ó (1.3 if international)
       √ó (0.8 if long-term lease)
       √ó (1.25 if peak hours)
       √ó (0.9 if night)
       √ó (1.15 if holiday)
       √ó (0.9 if weekend)
```

**Base rate**: per-use (e.g., $500) or per-hour (e.g., $300/hr)

**Configurable time bands**: peak (e.g., 6‚Äì9, 17‚Äì20), night (23‚Äì5), etc.

### üåç Airport Size & Flexibility Logic

| Airport Size | Slot Model                      | Gate Use Behavior           | Airline Preference                        |
| :----------- | :------------------------------ | :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| Large        | Fixed-time blocks (90‚Äì120 min)  | Rigid scheduling, max revenue | Major Legacy Carriers (exclusive/preferred gates) |
| Medium       | Mixed (some fixed, some flexible) | Adaptive scheduling         | Low-Cost Carriers (for lower fees)       |
| Small        | Fully flexible                  | Charge per real usage time  | Regional Airlines (to avoid overpaying)  |

üí° **Small airlines prefer small/flexible airports to avoid overpaying for unused block time.**

## üéÆ Game Design Implementation

### Strategic Considerations

**For Airlines:**
- **Gate Type Selection**: Balance control vs. cost
- **Airport Selection**: Consider gate policies and pricing
- **Schedule Optimization**: Maximize slot utilization
- **Long-term vs. Short-term**: Lease strategy decisions

**For Players:**
- **Resource Management**: Limited gate availability creates constraints
- **Financial Planning**: Gate costs affect route profitability
- **Strategic Growth**: Must secure gates before expanding routes
- **Airport Relationships**: Different airports offer different opportunities

### Implementation Benefits

1. **Strategic Depth**: Players must plan gate usage efficiently
2. **Realistic Constraints**: Airports have finite capacity
3. **Economic Decisions**: Gate type selection affects profitability
4. **Airport Differentiation**: Different airports have different policies
5. **Scheduling Complexity**: Must consider slot times when planning

## üìä Detailed Gate Specifications

### Gate Capacity Examples

| Turnaround Time              | Slots per Gate/Day | Typical Use Case     |
| :--------------------------- | :----------------- | :------------------- |
| 45 min + 15 min = 60 min     | ~18/day            | Low-cost carriers, domestic |
| 75 min + buffer = 90 min     | ~12/day            | Full-service domestic |
| 90‚Äì120 min + buffer          | ~8‚Äì10/day          | Mixed use            |
| 180 min                      | ~6/day             | Long-haul hub       |

### Pricing Modifiers Detail

| Modifier              | Price Effect | Notes                                |
| :-------------------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **Gate Type**         | Varies       | Based on exclusive/preferential/common multipliers |
| **Domestic vs. Intl.**| +30%         | International flights incur higher fees |
| **Long-Term Lease**   | -20%         | For leases of 4+ weeks              |
| **Peak Hours**        | +25%         | E.g., 06:00‚Äì09:00 & 17:00‚Äì20:00     |
| **Night Hours**       | -10%         | E.g., 23:00‚Äì05:00 (less desirable)  |
| **Weekend**           | -10%         | Applies Saturday/Sunday              |
| **Holiday**           | +15%         | For major public holidays            |

### Airport Policy Examples

**Large Hub Airport (e.g., Heathrow-style):**
- Fixed 90-minute blocks for common-use gates
- High fees but guaranteed slots
- Preferred by major carriers with exclusive gates

**Regional Airport (e.g., Small European airports):**
- Flexible slot timing
- Lower base fees
- Pay-for-actual-use model
- Attractive to budget carriers

## üéØ Success Metrics

The gate system implementation will be successful when:

1. **Capacity Constraints**: Players experience realistic airport limitations
2. **Strategic Decisions**: Gate type and airport selection matter for profitability
3. **Resource Management**: Players must plan gate usage efficiently
4. **Financial Impact**: Gate costs meaningfully affect route economics
5. **Gameplay Depth**: Adds complexity without overwhelming new players

This system transforms Blueskye from a simple route-creation game into a sophisticated airline management simulation where every operational decision has strategic and financial implications.
