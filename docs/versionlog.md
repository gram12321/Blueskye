## [0.005]  - 2025-06-12 - Gamemechanics alpha

### Major Features & Changes
- **Core Game Mechanics Implemented**:
  - **Aircraft System**:
    - `src/lib/aircraft/aircraftTypes.ts`: Defines aircraft interfaces and properties (speed, range, maxPassengers, cost, fuel consumption).
    - `src/lib/aircraft/fleetService.ts`: Manages player's fleet (purchase, sell, maintain, track condition/flight hours).
    - `src/lib/aircraft/aircraftData.ts`: Contains available aircraft types (Boeing, Airbus).
  - **Cities & Geography**:
    - `src/lib/geography/cityTypes.ts`: Defines city interfaces (population, country, coordinates, demand multipliers).
    - `src/lib/geography/cityData.ts`: Initializes and manages city data (London, Paris, Lyon).
    - `src/lib/geography/distanceService.ts`: Calculates distances and travel times between cities.
  - **Route Management**:
    - `src/lib/routes/routeTypes.ts`: Defines route interfaces and status tracking.
    - `src/lib/routes/routeService.ts`: Manages route creation, progress, income, demand, and completion.
  - **Game State Integration**:
    - `src/lib/gamemechanics/gameState.ts`: Extended to include fleet, cities, active/completed routes, and total income.
    - `src/lib/gamemechanics/gameTick.ts`: Updated to process route progress and income generation each game tick.
  - **User Interface Components**:
    - `src/components/views/FleetView.tsx`: Displays owned aircraft, allows purchase/sale/maintenance, shows fleet stats.
    - `src/components/views/RouteView.tsx`: Displays active routes with progress bars, allows route creation/cancellation, shows route stats.
    - *(Planned but not yet implemented: Geography/Map View for city info, demand, and route planning)*
- **Finance System Integration**: All major mechanics now use the centralized finance system for transaction tracking:
  - Aircraft purchases, sales, and maintenance now record transactions with appropriate categories and descriptions.
  - Route revenue and flight expenses (fuel costs) are now logged as financial transactions when flights complete.
- **Realistic Flight Progression**: Flight progress is now based on actual flight hours:
  - Each game day advances flight progress by a percentage based on the route's real flight time (distance/speed), rather than a fixed weekly increment.
  - Aircraft flight hours and condition are updated accurately upon route completion.
- **Improved Transaction Tracking**: All financial actions (buy/sell/maintain aircraft, route revenue/expenses) are visible in the Finance view's cash flow and transaction history.
- **Bug Fixes & Refactoring**:
  - Removed direct player money updates from mechanics; all money changes now go through the finance system.
  - Improved error handling for missing aircraft types and invalid operations.
  - Enhanced transaction descriptions for clarity in financial reports.
